The best fit synthetic cluster (SYC) is obtained via one of two likelihood
equations.

The ``tolstoy`` method in the **Cluster parameters assignation** block (``BF``
ID line) uses Eqs. 9, 10 & 11 defined in the original article describing
**ASteCA**.

The ``dolphin`` method uses Eq. 10 in the `Dolphin (2002)`_ article. This
equation compares the `Hess diagrams`_ of the observed SC vs the SYC, as shown
in :numref:`fig-likelihood`.

   Observed and synthetic clusters (left) are compared via their
   respective Hess diagrams (center and right). The minimum :math:`-\ln(PLR)`
   value determines the best fit SYC. Click on the image to enlarge.

When ``dolphin`` is used to obtain the best fit SYC, the membership
probabilities obtained by the decontamination algorithm (see Sect.
:ref:`decont-algor`) are included in the equation via the ``weights`` parameter
in the `numpy.histogramdd`_ function.
